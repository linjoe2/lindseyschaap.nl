                <p>As the Computer Science class creator and instructor at Media Wegwijs, I have had the pleasure of developing and delivering innovative, interactive, and engaging classes to students of all ages. Using cutting-edge technologies such as microbit and scratch, as well as creating unique experiences like a QR code adventure hunt, I have been able to provide students with a fun and exciting way to learn about the world of computer science. Whether it's teaching basic programming concepts or introducing more advanced techniques.</p>

                <p>As the computer science teacher at Kesper College, I was faced with a challenging situation. The students had gone without a teacher for two years, and with exams looming just two months away, they were in desperate need of guidance and support.</p>
                    
                    <p>To achieve this, I used a range of innovative teaching techniques, including bringing in a broken computer for the students to disassemble and other interactive classes. By making the classes fun and interactive, I was able to engage the students and help them to understand complex concepts in a way that was easy to grasp.</p>
                    
                    <p>The results were truly impressive. Thanks to my efforts, all of the students were able to pass their exams, despite the challenging circumstances. I am proud to have played a role in helping these students achieve their goals and to have inspired a passion for computer science that will stay with them for years to come.</p>

                <p>As a Full Stack JS Course Instructor, I had the opportunity to guide students through a comprehensive 3-month coding camp from zero to hero. I was responsible for creating the course content, teaching, and providing guidance throughout the program.</p>

                    <p>Thanks to my efforts, many of my students have gone on to secure positions at major companies like Tesla and Google. Throughout the program, I taught them essential skills such as HTML, CSS, JS, Node JS, and SQL databases.</p>
                    
                    <p>It was a privilege to watch my students grow and develop their skills over the course of the program, and I am proud to have played a role in helping them to achieve their career goals.</p>
